name: execplan
description: "When writing complex features or significant refactors or user ask explicitly, use an ExecPlan from design to implementation."
---

## Workflow

1. Locate the plan file path the user wants, or search in `plans` folder in the repo when needed.
2. Decide whether to create a new ExecPlan or update an existing one; append a short change note at the end when revising.
3. Use the template and rules in `references/execplan-guide.md`.
4. Ensure the plan is self-contained, plain language, and executable by a novice with only the plan and the repo.
5. Name the plan like this example `0001-title-of-the-plan.md`

## Rules

Do not commit the plan file.
